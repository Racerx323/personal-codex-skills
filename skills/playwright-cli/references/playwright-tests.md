# Running Playwright Tests

To run Playwright tests, use the `npx playwright test` command, or a package manager script. To avoid opening the interactive html report, use `PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never` environment variable.

```bash
# Run all tests
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never npx playwright test

# Run all tests through a custom npm script
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never npm run special-test-command
```

## Debugging Playwright Tests

To debug a failing Playwright test, run it with `--debug=cli` option. This command will pause the test at the start and print the debugging instructions.

**IMPORTANT**: run the command in the background and check the output until "Debugging Instructions" is printed. Make sure to stop the command after you have finished.

Once instructions containing a session name are printed, use `playwright-cli` to attach the session and explore the page.

```bash
# Run the test
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never npx playwright test --debug=cli
# ...
# ... debugging instructions for "tw-abcdef" session ...
# ...

# Attach to the test
playwright-cli attach tw-abcdef
```

Keep the test running in the background while you explore and look for a fix.
The test is paused at the start, so you should step over or pause at a particular location
where the problem is most likely to be.

Every action you perform with `playwright-cli` generates corresponding Playwright TypeScript code.
This code appears in the output and can be copied directly into the test. Update a stale locator when the observed page supports the change. Preserve requested
assertions: a failed expectation may expose an application regression. Confirm
intended behavior with the user before changing an assertion to match the current app.

After fixing the test, stop the background test run. Rerun to check that test passes.
